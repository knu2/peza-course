Below is a detailed outline for a follow-up course titled **"Mastering RAG, Knowledge Graphs, and GraphRAG for Data Analytics"**, designed as a natural progression from the "Python with AI for Data Analytics" course. This course targets beginners who have completed the foundational course and now have basic Python and data analytics skills, but no prior experience with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs, or GraphRAG. It builds on their ability to use Python and an AI assistant, introducing advanced AI-driven techniques to query and analyze data from documents, tables, and databases. The course integrates an AI assistant (e.g., Grok) to guide coding and concept exploration, mirroring the previous course's approach.
