Below is a beginner's course titled **"Python with AI for Data Analytics"**, designed for students with no prior Python or data science/analytics experience. It mirrors the approach of DeepLearning.AI's "AI Python for Beginners" by integrating an AI assistant (e.g., an LLM like Grok) into the learning process to guide coding, provide examples, and assist with debugging. The course focuses on practical, hands-on applications in data analytics, leveraging AI to simplify tasks like data cleaning, visualization, and basic predictive modeling. The objective is to empower beginners to use Python and AI collaboratively for real-world data analytics projects.
