Below is a beginner's course titled **"Python with AI for Data Analytics"**, designed for students with no prior Python or data science/analytics experience. It mirrors the approach of DeepLearning.AI’s "AI Python for Beginners" by integrating an AI assistant (e.g., an LLM like Grok) into the learning process to guide coding, provide examples, and assist with debugging. The course focuses on practical, hands-on applications in data analytics, leveraging AI to simplify tasks like data cleaning, visualization, and basic predictive modeling. The objective is to empower beginners to use Python and AI collaboratively for real-world data analytics projects.

  - Hands-on coding with step-by-step guidance from an AI assistant (assumed to be accessible, e.g., via a platform like xAI’s tools or a similar LLM interface).
  - Practical projects rooted in data analytics, such as analyzing sales data or survey results.
  - Emphasis on AI as both a learning companion and a tool for analytics tasks.
- **Prerequisites**: None—starts from scratch with Python and introduces data analytics concepts gradually.
- **Duration**: Approximately **25 hours** total, spread across 5 modules, with flexibility for self-paced learning.
- **Tools**: Python (via Google Colab or a local IDE like VS Code), Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and an AI assistant (e.g., Grok or ChatGPT for code generation/explanation).
- **Outcome**: By the end, students will write Python code with AI help, perform basic data analytics, and use AI to automate repetitive tasks like data summarization.
